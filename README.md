# Energy Management Forecasting

- Developed a predictive model to forecast energy consumption patterns and optimize energy usage.  

- Collected and preprocessed historical energy consumption data for model training.  

- Implemented machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict future energy demands.  

- Evaluated model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).  

- Improved energy efficiency by analyzing forecasts to guide load balancing and energy distribution.
